#Excel Data Visualization Project - MySQL Data Analysis
This project is focused on extracting data from a MySQL database, performing various data manipulation tasks using SQL, and visualizing the results in Excel. The project involves using SQL joins, Common Table Expressions (CTE), subqueries, date functions, CASE statements, and various aggregate functions to analyze and transform the data. The final step involves importing the extracted data into Excel to create Pivot tables and Pivot charts for visualization.

##Project Overview
In this project, we were tasked with performing different data analysis tasks using SQL and visualizing the results in Excel. Here is an overview of the workflow:

###Task Definition:

At the beginning of each task, a clear description of the task is provided. This helps in understanding the objective of the analysis.
###SQL Queries:

SQL queries are used to extract, transform, and aggregate data from a MySQL database.
We have used a variety of SQL techniques, including joins, CTEs, subqueries, date functions, CASE statements, and aggregate functions, depending on the specific task requirements.
Each task is accompanied by the SQL query used to accomplish it.
###Data Extraction:

After executing the SQL queries, the resulting tables are generated in the database.
We select the required columns from these tables to create a focused dataset.
###Data Export to Excel:

The selected columns from the database are copied into an Excel workbook.
This Excel workbook serves as the foundation for data visualization.
###Data Visualization:

In Excel, we utilize Pivot tables and Pivot charts to visualize the analyzed data.
Pivot tables are used to summarize and aggregate data, providing insights into the dataset.
Pivot charts are created to graphically represent the results, making it easier to understand and interpret the findings.
